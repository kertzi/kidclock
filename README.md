# Kidclock

I have three years old kid who wakes up early, like 06:00 in morning. This clock is developed to educate when it's ok to wake up and when one should continue sleeping.

Clock changes color to GREEN when it's ok for kid to wake up otherwise it's RED when its sleep time still. 


This small program with raspberry pi with 7" screen could be great combination for simple clock screen in kids room.

# setup
